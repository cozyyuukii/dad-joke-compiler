🤖 Dad Joke Compiler | BitWise Games

"Compiling dad jokes and breaking production since 2023."

Dad Joke Compiler is the neuro-linked, slightly chaotic, and pizza-fueled home of BitWise Games. It's a portfolio site wrapped in a neon cyberpunk terminal that features interactive particles, retro-futuristic vibes, and a system status monitor that is perpetually "breeding code hamsters."

✨ Features

Neon Chaos: A high-contrast aesthetic with Silkscreen headers and Source Code Pro text, bathed in glowing neon blue (#00f3ff) and magenta (#ff00ff).

Interactive Particle Grid: A custom HTML5 Canvas background that reacts to mouse movements and touch, simulating a neuro-linked network.

Terminal Interface: An animated command-line interface with typing effects, scanlines, and status updates like "Defragmenting dad jokes..." and "Downloading more RAM."

RGB Mode: Click the main "BitWise Games" title to cycle the entire site's color theme through a random RGB array.

Meme Hotline: A contact form that validates input and generates a mailto link so you can send your best memes directly to the vault.
